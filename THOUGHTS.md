# Pragmatic Thoughts

My pragmatic thoughts as a lead front-end engineer.

## Prefer technical debt over bankruptcy

You should try to avoid technical debt in your product *unless* you are not delivering its values on time and risk bankruptcy for your business.

Afterall, your debt-free code means nothing if it's not meeting its ends for users and stakeholders.

## Factor in all types of group

You should factor in all groups involved in the makings of your product: users, stakeholders, product owners, developers, designers, etc. Being obsessed with serving a particular group of people will lead into a business failure.

## Serve real users and not the imaginary ones

You should serve real users and not the imaginary ones you have not even met before. When you add or remove things based on what you think users want, your business will pay a big price for nothing. Users may not know what they want but you can only guess it from interacting with real users.

## Don't be a slave to best practices

You should follow best practices while you can afford it and be ready to break those practices when your business priority shifts. Being adoptive is far more important for your business than being a slave to best practices that are created by other organizations in the other context.
