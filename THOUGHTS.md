# Pragmatic Thoughts

My pragmatic thoughts as a lead front-end engineer.

## Prefer technical debt over bankruptcy

You should try to avoid technical debt in your product *unless* you are not delivering its values on time and risk bankruptcy for your business.

Afterall, your debt-free code means nothing if it's not meeting its ends for users and stakeholders.
